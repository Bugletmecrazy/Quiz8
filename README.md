## Part 1 Imaging Technique Inspiration
I would like to use p5.js to make a familiar image like Wheels of Fortune made by Pacita Abad. From 1999 to 2000, She created a series of art work in different symbols of circle. Different circles mean the change and diversity of destiny. The most fundamental part is create random colorful circle without any overlaps using p5.js. And then further research should be placed in creating circles in circles. Last, the colors used in circles should be considered in order to make the image looks more artistic.

## Part 2 Coding Technique Exploration
I found a video is helpful for me. It is a p5.js tutorial published in Youtube. It is a logical and mathematics things rather than specific high level technique. The author first created an array to save all the valid circle. And then, he created the 500 circles in a loop function and there is function inside the loop to detect if the circle is overlapped with others. If so, he dropped the circle. I find this method is useful and it is likely could be used in create different circles without overlaps.
